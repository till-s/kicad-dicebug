# The DiceBug

*by Till Straumann, 2023*

## Introduction

This is a simple electronics project that I have created to
teach kids how electronic circuits are "built" -- in a physical
sense. They don't have to understand how it works (6 year olds
have assembled the bug) but just have fun placing the small
components on the board, watch the solder melt in the toaster
oven and walk away with the finished product.

The cute bug features a motion sensor and operates as an "electronic
dice" cycling throught the familiar pattern of pips we know from
traditional dice. The cycling is randomly triggered by hand motion
and happens too fast to control the outcome. When the hand is withdrawn
the bug will show a random facet.

The bug is operated by a CR2032 lithium battery. A small power-switch
is located at the tail end of the animal.

Occasionally, the motion sensor may have to recalibrate itself
(the dice seems to be "stuck" when that happens). Just leave it alone
for several seconds (no touching) and it will come back to life.

Since the battery is exposed don't store the or operate the device
in a conducting bag or box.

## Warning
*Keep (any type of) batteries away from small children. Swallowing
batteries can be life-threatening!*
